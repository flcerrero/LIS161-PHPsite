Project / Website Title:
Official Website of Municipality of Tanza

This project proposes an official website for the municipality of Tanza, Cavite. Tanza has a Weebly website but it is not being utilized and does not contain pertinent information regarding the locality. This project aims to provide a layout for the official site as well as possible contents of the municipal website.

Intended User/Client:
Since this is a website of a locality, its primary client would be the local government of Tanza since they will be handling it and will be responsible of the contents and posts on the website. Its target audience and users are the locals of Tanza since it will serve as an extension of the physical bulletin board in the municipal hall as well as other people interested in visiting the town. The website contains a guide of tourist spots and destinations to explore while visiting Tanza. It also has a message form where the community can send their queries and complaints to the municipality.<br>

II.	Functional Requirements<br>
The website has a public side and admin side. Log in page is not included in the navigation bar for it to be exclusive to municipal employees for access. It also contains the link for sign up page. Signing up and logging in will both redirect to admin landing page.
<br>
An admin panel can be seen on the left side of the page. The admin/user side allows access to pages where message submissions via Contact Us page and sign up forms are displayed. Registered users can edit the recipient of a message so that it can be sorted out properly during search. A search page for registered users is also set up if one wants to search for admins from certain barangays or for a specific person.<br>

User sign up, login, message submission through Contact Us page<br>
